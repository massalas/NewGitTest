# NewGitTest

So basically all my functions exist in the Page.py.

I also have all my element locators in the locators.py, 
so any time I am using an element locator I am importing
it from the locator file.

There's also the SWSuite2 file where I add my tests to the Suite,
using the code you send me.


In order to run the tests you should have selenium standalone server installed and running in the background.

Then you can either execute the SWSuite2 file and run the whole suite of tests
or execute each test case seperately by running: python test_mpla_mpla.py

Enjoy :)
